<h1>Welcome to Apache Axis2 version 1.2</h1>

<h3>@TODAY@</h3>
<pre>Just over 4 months since the original 1.1.1 release, we are very proud to
announce the release of Apache Axis2 version 1.2

Downloads are available at:
    http://ws.apache.org/axis2/download.cgi

Apache Axis2 is a complete re-design and re-write of the widely used
Apache Axis engine and is a more efficient, more scalable, more modular
and more XML-oriented Web services framework. It is carefully designed to
support the easy addition of plug-in "modules" that extend its
functionality for features such as security and reliability.

Modules supporting WS-Security/Secure-Conversation (Apache Rampart),
WS-Trust (Apache Rahas), WS-Reliable Messaging (Apache Sandesha) and
WS-Eventing (Apache Savan) will be available after the Apache Axis2
1.2 release. Please see these projects' own sites for further information.

Major Changes Since 1.1:
- WSDL 2.0 fully support (reading, writing, and codegen)
- POJO annotation (JSR 181)
- JAX-WS integration
- JAX-WS -annotation
- Un-wrapping (Response) 
- ADB - support for union and list
- Maven2 support
- JSON support 
- Binary serialization (Fast infoste)
- Codegen support for WSDL with Multiple services
- HTTP code generation (both WSDL 1.1 and 2.0)
- Custom deployer support
- Message formatters
- Message Builders
- EJB Provider support



Known Issues and Limitations in 1.2 Release:

- Xml-beans databinding does not support response uwwrapping
- ADB databinding does not support minOccurs and maxOccures attributes in sequence and choice elements
 (i.e) <sequence minOccurs="0" maxOccurs="unbounded"></sequence>  


Apache Axis2 1.2 is a major new release compared to Axis2 1.1. We are
striving for a simple and happy first time user experience as well as a
satisfying experienced user experience with this release. We welcome any
