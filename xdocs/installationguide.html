<title>Axis2 Installation Guide</title>
</head>
<body>
<h3><a name="_Toc96698081"></a>Introduction </h3>
<p>Axis 2.0 can be downloaded as a <a href="releases.html">zipped binary </a> 
or the <a href="http://svn.apache.org/viewcvs.cgi/webservices/axis/trunk/?root=Apache-SVN">source </a>.
This section describes how Axis2 can be installed either as a
standalone server or as part of a J2EE compliant servlet container. </p>

<h3><a name="_Toc96698082"></a>Prerequisites </h3>
<p>Axis2 requires the Java Runtime Environment to be properly
installed. Axis2 is developed to be run on JRE 1.4 and upwards but it
has not been fully tested with the latest JRE 1.5. Hence it is safe to
run Axis2 with Java 1.4. If the JRE is not already in place it must be
installed to proceed further. For instructions on setting up the JRE in
different operating systems, please visit <a href="http://java.sun.com/">http://java.sun.com </a>. </p>
<p>All the required jars are shipped with the binary distribution and
if the source distribution is used, running the maven build will
automatically download the required jars for you. </p>
<p>Following sections describe how each type of distribution needs to
be installed. Since the process with the source distribution is similar
to the binary distribution after building, the first section explains
the process of building Axis2 from source. If you have the binary
distribution you can skip the build sections and directly go to the
binary installation section. </p>
<h3><a name="_Toc96698083"></a>Building Axis2 from source </h3>
<h4><a name="_Toc96698084"></a>Setting up the Environment and the tools </h4>
<p>The Axis2 build is based on <a href="http://maven.apache.org/">Maven </a>.
Hence the only prerequisite to build Axis2 from source distribution is to have Maven
installed. Even though extensive instruction guides are available at
the Maven site, this guide also contains the easiest path for quick
environment setting. Advanced users who wish to know more about Maven
can visit <a href="http://maven.apache.org/start/index.html">here </a>. </p>

<p>For Windows users the easiest way is to download the windows
installer package. Once the installer package is run, all the necessary
environment variables will be properly set. Once Maven is installed,
the success of the installation can be tested by typing maven
version in the command prompt. </p>

<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>
For Unix/Linux users the tar ball or the zip archive is the best
option. Once the archive is downloaded expand it to a directory of
choice and set the environment variable MAVEN_HOME and add
MAVEN_HOME/bin to the path as well. More instructions for installing
Maven in Unix based operating systems can be found <a href="http://maven.apache.org/start/install.html">here </a>. </p>
<p>Once maven is properly installed it's all that is needed to start building Axis2. </p>
<h4><a name="_Toc96698085"></a>The Axis2 source distribution </h4>
<p>The <a href="releases.html">source distribution </a> is available as
a zipped archive. All the necessary build scripts are
included with the source distribution. Once the source archive is
expanded into a directory of choice, moving to the particular directory
and running maven command will build the Axis2 jar file. </p>

<p align="center"><img alt="clip_image004 (43K)" src="images/maven.jpg" height="338" width="669" /></p>
<p>Once the command completes, the binaries (jar files in this case) can be found at a newly created "target" directory. </p>
<p><strong>Note  For the first Maven build (if the maven repository is
not built first) it will take a while since required jars need to be
downloaded. However this is a once only process and will not affect any
successive builds. </strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong>The default maven build will however build only
the Axis2 jar file. To obtain a WAR (Web Archive), "maven war" command
should be issued. This will create a complete WAR with the name
axis2.war inside the target directory. </p>
<p>Once this build step is complete, the binaries are ready to be deployed. </p>
<h3><a name="_Toc96698086"></a>Installing Axis2 in a Servlet container </h3>
<p>Installation of the WAR is quite simple. It's a matter of dropping
the war in the webapps folders and most servlet containers will
automatically install the war. However some servlet containers may
require a restart in order to capture the new web application. Please
refer your servlet container documentation for more information about
this. </p>
<p>Once the WAR is successfully installed it can be tested by pointing the web 
browser to the <strong>http:// &lt;host :port&gt;/ axis2. </strong>It should produce the following page.
</p>
<p align="center"><strong><img src="images/clip_image006.jpg"></strong></p>
<p>
To ensure that everything is fine and smooth, a probing of the system can be done 
through the validate link. If the validation fails then the war has failed to 
install properly or some essential jars are missing. At such a situation the 
documentation of the particular servlet container should be consulted to find 
the problem. The following page is a successful validation. Note the statement 
core Axis2 libraries are present.
</p>

<p>
The Axis2 web application also provides an interface to upload services. 
Once a service is created according to the service specification as described in 
userguide that jar file can be uploaded using the upload page.
</p>
<p align="center"><strong><img src="images/clip_image010.jpg"></strong></p>
<p>The uploaded jar files will be stored in the default service
directory. For Axis2 this will be the
&lt;webapps&gt;/axis2/WEB-INF/services directory. Once a service is
uploaded it will be instantly installed. </p>
<p>Since Axis2 supports hot deployment one can drop the service jar
directly through the file system to the above mentioned services
directory and it will also cause the service to be automatically
installed without the container being restarted. </p>

<p>To check the successful installation of a service <strong><em>available services link </em></strong>
is provided. The services and the operations of successfully installed
services will be displayed in the available services page.</p>
<p align="center"><strong><img src="images/clip_image012.jpg"></strong></p>
<p>If the service has deployment time error it will listed out those services as faulty services. 
And If you click on the link it will show your the deployment fault</p>

<p>Axis2 Administration  is all about configuring Axis2 at the run time and
the configuration will be transient , and more descriptions are avilable in
