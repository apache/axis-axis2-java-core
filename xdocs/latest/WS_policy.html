<h2>What is Web Services (WS) Policy?</h2>

<p>To consume non trivial web services one must fully understand its xml
contract (WSDL) along with any other additional requirements, capabilities or
preferences which translates to the configuration of the service, and
essentially becomes the policies of the service.</p>

<p>WS Policy framework provides a way to express the policies of a service in
a machine-readable way. Web services infrastructure can be enhanced to
understand and enforce policies at runtime. For instance, a service author
might write a policy requiring digital signature and encryption, while
service consumers could use the policy information to reason out whether they
can adhere to this policy information to use the service or not.</p>

<p>Further more, web service infrastructure could be enhanced to enforce
those requirements without requiring the service author to write even single
line of code.</p>

<h2>Client Side WS-Policy Support</h2>

<p>This release <strong>fully supports WS Policy at client-side</strong>. It
means that when you codegen a stub against a WSLD which contains policies,
the stub will contain the capability to engage the required modules with the
appropriate configurations. For instance, if there is a security policy
attached to an operation in the WSDL, the generated stub will engage the
security module for that operation with the appropriate security
configurations.</p>

<h3>How it works:</h3>

<h4>Phase 1: At PolicyEvaluator</h4>

<p>Codegen engine runs few of its registered extensions before it generates
the stub. When PolicyEvalutor (which is a registered Codegen extension) is
initialized, it populates a registry of namespaces of supported policies to
PolicyExtensions.</p>

<p>For instance, module foo might have a mapping of namespace
http://test.com/foo which means any primitive assertion which has this
namespace will be processed by this module. Foo module might implement the
ModulePolicyExtension interface through which PolicyExtension object can be
obtained.</p>

<p>A <strong>PolicyExtension</strong> is the access point for a module to add
any other methods to the stub. For instance Reliable Messaging module can add
createSequence() and endSequence() methods to the stub, that the user must
call to start and end an RM sequence.</p>

<p>Then at the engagement of PolicyEvaluator, effective policy of each
operation is calculated based on policy information declared in the WSDL
document. Here we assume that effective policy of an operation contains a
single alternative (<strong>Multiple policy alternatives are not
supported</strong>). Then we split that policy as follows into few other
policies such that, each policy will contain primitive assertions belonging
to only one namespace.</p>
<pre>  &lt;wsp:Policy&gt;         &lt;wsp:Policy&gt;       &lt;wsp:Policy&gt;           &lt;wsp:Policy&gt;
    &lt;a:Foo/&gt;             &lt;a:Foo/&gt;           &lt;b:Foo/&gt;               &lt;c:Bar/&gt;
    &lt;a:Bar/&gt;      =&gt;     &lt;a:Bar/&gt;         &lt;/wsp:Policy&gt;          &lt;/wsp:Policy&gt;
    &lt;b:Foo/&gt;           &lt;/wsp:Policy&gt;
    &lt;c:Bar/&gt;
  &lt;/wsp:Policy&gt;</pre>

<p>Then each policy is given to the appropriate PolicyExtension with an
org.w3c.Element type object to which the module can append any other
elements/attributes it wishes. Those attributes/elements should resolve to
meaningful stub functions via PolicyExtensionTemplate.xsl at latter point of
time.</p>

<p>For instance depending on the policy, Security module can append
&lt;username&gt;, &lt;passwd&gt; elements to the given element as children,
which are later resolved into setUsername(..), setPasswd(..), functions of
the stub. This way a module can include additional methods to the stub which
can be used to get specific parameters to the module. These methods store any
user input in the ServiceClient properties
(ServiceClient.getOptions().putProperty(...)) which can later be accessed by
the module.</p>

<h4>Phase 2: At MultiLanguageClientEmitter</h4>

<p>Further, effective policies (based on the WSDL) at appropriate levels
(service level, operation level) are stored as policy strings in the stub.
Few more generic methods are also added to the stub which are used to
evaluate/process policies at runtime.</p>

<h4>Phase 3: Runtime</h4>

<p>When a new stub object is created, the policy strings in the stub are
converted into policy objects and merged together to get the effective
policies of each operation. These effective policies are stored in
appropriate AxisOperation objects which a module can access at later point of
time.</p>

<p>Then based on its policy each AxisOperation is engaged to a set of
modules.</p>

<p>When the stub method is invoked, those modules which are engaged to that
AxisOperation, access the effective policy for that operation via
AxisOperation object. It can get other information needed from the
MessageContext which get stored by stub methods which the module has added to
the stub earlier. The modules are required to loads their configurations
according to the effective policy which is set in AxisOperation and
properties they get via MessageContext.</p>

<h2>Server Side WS-Policy Support</h2>

<p>In this current release Axis2 framework uses ws-commons/policy as an
object model to manipulate policy documents. All its description builders
store any policy information included in description documents (services.xml,
axis2.xml, .. etc) in the appropriate description classes. This information
is available at both deployment and run time via these description
classes.</p>

<p>When generating WSDL dynamically for each service, policy information in
the description classes is included. For instance, if you declare a policy in
axis2.xml then that policy is reflected in service elements of WSDL of every
service. If a policy is declared in a services.xml, it is shown in the
service element of WSDL for that particular service.</p>

<p>Next step is to use that information to engage and configure required
modules and allow the module to make use of this policy information.</p>

<p>It is evident that a great deal of work is required to make axis2 a fully
fledged ws-policy supported web service infrastructure. But it is encouraging
to note that we've taken the first steps towards this goal. We appreciate any
suggestions, patches etc you send us in this regard. Keep on
contributing...!</p>
