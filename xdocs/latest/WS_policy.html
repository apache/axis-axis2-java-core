<h2>What is Web Services (WS) Policy?</h2>

<p>To consume non trivial web services one must fully understand its xml
contract (WSDL) along with any other additional requirements, capabilities or
preferences which translates to the configuration of the service, and
essentially becomes the policies of the service.</p>

<p>WS Policy framework provides a way to express the policies of a service in
a machine-readable way. Web services infrastructure can be enhanced to
understand and enforce policies at runtime. For instance, a service author
might write a policy requiring digital signature and encryption, while
service consumers could use the policy information to reason out whether they
can adhere to this policy information to use the service or not.</p>

<p>Further more, web service infrastructure could be enhanced to enforce
those requirements without requiring the service author to write even single
line of code.</p>

<h2>What's in this release?</h2>

<p>In this current release Axis2 framework uses ws-commons/policy as an
object model to manipulate policy documents. All its description builders
store any policy information included in description documents (services.xml,
axis2.xml, .. etc) in the appropriate description classes. This information
is available at both deployment and run time via these description
classes.</p>

<p>When generating WSDL dynamically for each service, policy information in
the description classes is included. For instance, if you declare a policy in
axis2.xml then that policy is reflected in service elements of WSDL of every
service. If a policy is declared in a services.xml, it is shown in the
service element of WSDL for that particular service.</p>

<p>Next step is to use that information to engage and configure required
modules and allow the module to make use of this policy information.</p>

<p>It is evident that a great deal of work is required to make axis2 a fully
fledged ws-policy supported web service infrastructure. But it is encouraging
to note that we've taken the first steps towards this goal. We appreciate any
suggestions, patches etc you send us in this regard. Keep on
contributing...!</p>
