<h1>JiBX Integration With Axis2</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.jibx.org">JiBX data binding</a> supports fast and
flexible conversions between plain old Java objects (POJOs) and XML. JiBX uses a
mapped binding approach that's based on a binding definition document you
provide. This lets you customize the way your Java objects are converted to and
from XML. These features make JiBX especially useful if you're developing a Web
service based on existing Java code.</p>

<p>Axis2 supports using JiBX with your web services, including generating the
necessary linkage code for both client and server side. However, the Axis2
support for JiBX doesn't currently include code generation from the schema for a
web service - you need to provide your own data classes and JiBX binding
definition, and you also need to make sure that the binding definition matches
the XML structures defined for your web service. The JiBX project provides some
basic tools to help with code generation from schema, binding generation from
Java classes, and schema generation from the combination of Java classes and a
binding definition. In the future improved versions of these tools will be
integrated directly into the Axis2 framework support, but for now you're on your
own with this part of the setup.</p>

<p>You can use JiBX data binding both to expose existing Java code as a service,
and to build a client for an existing service. This document runs through the
sequence of steps involved for each of these cases, just to help users
understand the basic approach to working with JiBX in Axis2. You can find full
instructions on the standard JiBX parts of this sequence on the
<a href="http://www.jibx.org">JiBX web site</a>.</p>

<h2>Starting from Java</h2>

<p>Here's the sequence of steps for using JiBX with Axis2 to expose existing
Java code as a web service:</p>

<ol>
<li>Create a JiBX binding definition for the data being transferred by the web
service</li>
<li>Create a schema that matches the XML defined by your binding (you may be
able to use the JiBX schema generator to help with this)</li>
<li>Create a WSDL document for your service, with the schema embedded or
imported</li>
<li>Generate Axis2 server-side linkage code using WSDL2Java with the WSDL and
your binding definition</li>
<li>Run the JiBX binding compiler on your Java classes to add the actual binding
code</li>
<li>Include the <i>axis2-jibx.jar</i> in your runtime classpath, along with the
<i>jibx-runtime.jar</i> (normally done by including these in the
<i>axis2/WEB-INF/lib</i> directory)</li>
</ol>

<p>The above is assuming your code already provides methods to implement the
operations you want to expose as a web service, that these methods each take a
single parameter object that's unique to the method and each return a single
response object. If this is <i>not</i> the case, you'll also need to create
wrapper classes and perhaps wrapper methods for now. See the
<a href="./jibx-example.html">JiBX example</a> for more details on this.</p>

<h2>Starting from WSDL</h2>

<p>Here's the sequence of steps for using JiBX with Axis2 to implement a client
for an existing web service (or the service stubs for implementing the
service):</p>

<ol>
<li>Create Java classes for the data being transferred by the web service, and a
JiBX binding definition that maps these classes to the schema defined by the web
service (you may be able to use the JiBX xsd2jibx tool to help with this)</li>
<li>Generate Axis2 client linkage code using WSDL2Java with the WSDL and your
binding definition</li>
<li>Run the JiBX binding compiler on your Java classes to add the actual binding
code</li>
<li>Include the <i>axis2-jibx.jar</i> in your runtime classpath, along with the
<i>jibx-runtime.jar</i></li>
</ol>

<h2>Axis2 JiBX code generation</h2>

<p>To run the WSDL2Java tool for JiBX data binding you need to specify
<i>-d jibx</i> to select JiBX binding. You also need an additional parameter,
<i>-Ebindingfile {file}</i> (where <i>{file}</i> is the file path to your JiBX
binding definition). Finally, you need to have the <i>axis2-jibx.jar</i>, the
<i>jibx-bind-1.1beta2.jar</i>, and the <i>jibx-run-1.1beta2.jar</i> files from
your Axis2 distribution included in the WSDL2Java classpath.</p>

<h2>Coming attractions</h2>

<p>Soon after the release of Axis2 1.0 the JiBX support will be extended to
support automatic handling of "wrapped" doc/lit services. This will dramatically
reduce the number of classes that need to be defined for working with simple
services, and simplify both starting from Java and starting from WSDL. The full
JiBX 1.1 release will also provide much improved support for code generation
from schemas, and for binding+schema generation from code, and these features
will be integrated into the Axis2 JiBX support. Check the
<a href="http://www.jibx.org">JiBX project site</a> for updates on both JiBX 1.1
and the Axis2 JiBX support.</p>
