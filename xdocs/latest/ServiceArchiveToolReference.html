<h1>Service Archive Wizard - Eclipse Plug-in</h1>

<p><a href="http://ws.apache.org/axis2/download.cgi">[Download]</a></p>

<p>Axis2 comes with a simple service archive tool. This tool provides easy to
use functionality to develop an Axis archive or an "aar" file or a "jar" file
that can be deployed as a web service to the Axis2. This tool is in the form
of an Eclipse plug-in and can be downloaded from the downloads section. This
document describes how the tool can be used.</p>

<h2>Installation</h2>

<p>Download the binary version of the plug-in and extract the content of the
zip file into the Eclipse installation folder. (The plug-in will actually go
into the plugins directory in the Eclipse installation root). Restarting
Eclipse will set the plug-in automatically.</p>

<h2>Operation</h2>

<p>If the plug-in is properly installed you should see a new wizard under the
"New" section.(use the File -&gt; New -&gt; Other or Ctrl + N )</p>

height="500"></p>

<p>Selecting the wizard and pressing the next button will start the service
generator wizard. Following is the first wizard page.</p>

<p align="center"><img alt="" border="0"
src="images/tools/service/ServicePage1.jpg" width="500" height="500"></p>

<p>Once the class file folder is given (which should be a folder in the file
system) the next button will be enabled.</p>

<p>Page 2 of the wizard requires you to locate the wsdl file. Note that the
WSDL file cannot be skipped in this version of the tool.</p>

<p align="center"><img alt="" border="0"
src="images/tools/service/service_page2.JPG" width="500" height="500"></p>

<p align="center">Select the service.XML file in the next wizard page</p>

<p align="center"><img alt="" border="0"
src="images/tools/service/service_page3.JPG" width="500" height="500"></p>

<p>Note that The service XML file can be generated if needed. To proceed to
the service generation page, check the "generate automatically" checkbox.</p>

<p align="center"><img alt="" border="0"
src="images/tools/service/service_page3_hl.JPG"></p>

<p>If the automatic mode is not selected, then the wizard will directly jump
to the library selection page. However if the automatic mode is selected the
wizard will show the following page.</p>

<p align="center"><img alt="" border="0"
src="images/tools/service/service_page4_plain.JPG" width="500"
height="500"></p>

<p>This is a somewhat complicated page. The service name textbox should
include the name of the service that you wish to give the service. For the
implementation class, type in the fully qualified class name and hit the load
button to view the operations.</p>

<p align="center"><img alt="" border="0"
src="images/tools/service/service_page4_load.JPG"></p>

<p>The loaded operations should be displayed in a table. Once this is
displayed you can filter the methods by selecting/deselecting the methods
using the checkbox at each row.</p>

<p align="center"><img alt="" border="0"
src="images/tools/service/service_page4_table.JPG" width="500"
height="500"></p>

<p>Further filtering can be achieved by using the "search declared methods"
only checkbox.</p>

<p align="center"><img alt="" border="0"
src="images/tools/service/service_page4_search_declared.JPG"></p>

<p>Once the method selection is complete the wizard has enough information to
generate a basic services.xml file. If further customization is required,
there's no choice but to manually edit it!</p>

<p>The next step is to add the libraries. The library addition page looks
like this</p>

<p align="center"><img alt="" border="0"
src="images/tools/service/service_page5.JPG"></p>

<p>The library name (with full path) can be either typed on the text box or
browsed for using the browse button.</p>

<p align="center"><img alt="" border="0"
src="images/tools/service/service_page5_browsed.JPG"></p>

<p>Hit the Add button to add the library to the list. The added libraries
should be displayed in the list box</p>

<p align="center"><img alt="" border="0"
src="images/tools/service/service_page5_hl.JPG"></p>

<p align="center"><img alt="" border="0"
src="images/tools/service/service_page5_added.JPG"></p>

<p>If any library needs to be removed, highlight it in the list and hit
remove. Click next to proceed to the last page of the wizard</p>

<p align="center"><img alt="" border="0"
src="images/tools/service/service_page5_remove.JPG"></p>

<p>The last page of the wizard asks for the output location and the output
archive name.</p>

<p></p>

<p align="center"><img alt="" border="0"
src="images/tools/service/service_page6.JPG"></p>

<p>Once all the parameters are filled, hit the finish button to complete the
wizard and generate the service archive.</p>

<p align="center"><img alt="" border="0"
src="images/tools/service/success_msg.JPG"></p>

<p>If you see the above message, then you've successfully generated the
service archive! This service archive can be hot deployed to Axis2</p>

<p>The plugin also adds a help document to the Eclipse help system. You
should see it if you go to Eclipse help content</p>
