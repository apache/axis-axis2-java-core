transports</a></h1>
<h3>CommonsHTTPTransportSender</h3>
<p>This is the default transport
sender that is being used in Server API as well as Client
API.&nbsp;HTTP
funtionality of the Sender is based on commons-httpclient-3.0-rc3. In
order to aquire the maxium flexibiliy, this sender has implemented POST
interface and GET interface. This is mainly due to the fact that Axis2
SOAP stack has the tendency to support REST based services as well. </p>
<p>
Chunking support and KeepAlive support also integrated via the
facilities provided by commons. It has the tendency to support HTTP
version 1.0 and 1.1. As Chunking support is only available in HTTP
version 1.1, thus, this distiction in sperating the tranport version
is important.
</p>
<p>
Tranport Sender sets in the axis2.xml's
&lt;tranposrtSender/&gt;
element, and it's being declared as follows,
</p>
<pre>&lt;transportSender name="http" class="org.apache.axis2.transport.http.CommonsHTTPTransportSender"&gt;<br>	&lt;parameter name="PROTOCOL" locked="xsd:false"&gt;HTTP/1.1&lt;/parameter&gt;<br>	&lt;parameter name="Transfer-Encoding"&gt;chunked&lt;/parameter&gt;<br>&lt;/transportSender&gt;<br></pre>
<code></code>
<p>Above code snippet shows the
complete configuration of the transport sender.
&lt;parameter/&gt; element introduces the additional paraments
that should be complient with the sender. HTTP PROTOCOL version sets as
HTTP/1.0 or HTTP/1.1. Default version is HTTP/1.1. It should be noted
that Chunking support is available at HTTP/1.1. Thus, the user should
be careful of setting the "chunked" property only with version 1.1.
KeepAlive is default in version 1.1.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These are the only paramenters
that is available from deployment. Other parameters such as character
encoding style etc, are provided via MessageContext. </p>
