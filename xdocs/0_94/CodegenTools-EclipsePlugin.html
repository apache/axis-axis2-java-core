<h1>Code Generator Wizard - Eclipse Plug-in</h1>

<p><a href="http://ws.apache.org/axis2/download.cgi">[Download]</a></p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The Axis2 code generator comes built-in with an <a
href="http://www.eclipse.org">Eclipse</a> plug-in. This document explains the
installation and usage of the Axis2 code generator plug-in.</p>

<h2>Installation</h2>

<p>The easiest way to obtain the plug-in would be the binary distribution.
The full Axis binary distribution contains the compiled version of this
plug-in under the tools directory.</p>

<p>If one needs to build the plugin from source it is not as trivial as
running the Maven build. The reason is that the plug-in depends heavily on
the Eclipse classes, which are only available in an Eclipse environment. The
recommended procedure is to run the create-project.xml (in the "modules\tool"
directory of the source distribution) build file which will create two
folders (the other one for the Service Archiver tool) and copy the necessary
files to relevant folders. Then Eclipse should be configured to open the
contents in a PDE project. Please go through the Eclipse documentation to
learn how to open projects in the PDE format.</p>

<p>Once you've obtained the plug-in just unzip the content of the plug-in
archive to the eclipse plug-in directory (if it is the zipped-binary version)
or copy the necessary folders to the eclipse plug-in directory and restart
Eclipse.</p>

<p><i>Note - This plug-in works on Eclipse version 3.1 and upwards. The
provided screen shots may slightly differ with what the user would actually
see but the fuctuonality has not been changed.</i></p>

<h2>Operation</h2>

<p>If the plug-in is properly installed you should see a new wizard under the
"New" section.(use the File -&gt; New -&gt; Other or Ctrl + N )</p>

<p>Selecting the wizard and pressing the next button will start the code
generator wizard. Following is the first wizard page.</p>

<p>Selecting the generate code from WSDL option leads to the next page. Note
that the Java-to-WSDL tool is disabled.</p>

<p>To move on to the next page the WSDL file location must be given. The
browse button can be used to easily browse for a file rather than typing the
whole path.</p>

<p>Once the WSDL file is selected, codegen options are to be selected. By far
this is the most important page in this wizard, which determines the
characteristics of the code being generated. Novices need not worry about
these options since the most common options are defaulted, But advanced users
will find it very easy to "turn the knobs" using these options.</p>

<p><em>Note - The databinding option "xmlbeans" would not work for Eclipse
version 3.0. This has been a known problem and users are recommended to use
Eclipse version 3.1 or upwards</em></p>

<p>Once the options are taken care of, only the final step of the code
generation is left. it is the selection of the output file location.</p>

<p>When the output file location is selected, the Finish button will be
enabled. Pressing the finish button will generate the code and a message box
will pop up acknowledging the success. Well Done! Now you are ready for Axis2
Code generation.</p>
