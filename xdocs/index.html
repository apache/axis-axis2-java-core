<h2>Welcome to Apache Axis2</h2>

<p>Apache Axis2 is an implementation of the <a
href="http://www.w3.org/TR/soap/">Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP)
Recommendation</a> from the <a href="http://www.w3.org">W3C</a>.  Axis2 can
be used to provide and consume Web Services.</p>

<p>From the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/soap/">W3C recommendation</a>:</p>

<div style="padding-left: 20px; padding-top: 5px; font-style:italic;">
"SOAP is a lightweight protocol for exchange of information in a
decentralized, distributed environment. It is an XML based protocol that
consists of three parts: an envelope that defines a framework for describing
what is in a message and how to process it, a set of encoding rules for
expressing instances of application-defined datatypes, and a convention for
representing remote procedure calls and responses."</div>

<p>Apache Axis2 is an effort to re-implement both Axis/Java and Axis/C++ on a
new architecture. Building upon the "handler chain" model developed in Axis1,
Axis2 introduces a more flexible pipeline architecture which leads itself to
greater modularity and extensibility. This extensibility will allow Axis2 to
act as a foundation for a growing constellation of associated Web Services
protocols including:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a

  <li><a
    href="http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=wss">WS-Security</a></li>
  <li><a

</ul>

<h2>Axis2 Background and Motivation</h2>

<p>Axis1 was built under the assumption that other protocols such as
WS-ReliableMessaging would be integrated into Axis1's handler chain.  Axis1
had the concept of a <a
href="http://ws.apache.org/axis/java/apiDocs/org/apache/axis/MessageContext.html">MessageContext</a>
and a chain of transport, service, and global message handlers, but Axis1
lacked a clear extension architecture to enable clean composition of such
layers. One of the key motivations for Axis2 is to provide a clean and simple
environment for implementations of associated WS standards such as <a
href="http://ws.apache.org/sandesha/">Apache Sandesha</a> and <a
href="http://ws.apache.org/wss4j/">Apache WSS4J</a>. Implementations of
associated standards should be able to easily interface with the base SOAP
Message handling system. In summary, Axis2 has a more modular and flexible
message handling pipeline. It focuses on the details of message handling and
provides clear hooks for implementations of associated Web Services standards
and protocols. This evolution will allow Axis to be a foundational technology
for next generation Web Services.</p>

<p>Axis2 introduces a representation for SOAP messages called <b>AXIOM (AXIs
Object Model)</b>. AXIOM consists of two parts: a complete XML Infoset
representation and a SOAP Infoset representation. The XML Infoset
representation provides a JDOM-esque API built on top a deferred model via a
StAX-based (Streaming API for XML) pull parsing API. A key feature of AXIOM
is that it allows one to stop building the XML tree and just access the pull
stream directly, enabling both maximum flexibility and maximum performance.
This approach allows Axis2 to support multiple levels of abstraction for
consuming and offering Web services using plain AXIOM, or using generated
code and statically data-bound data types and so on. Developers with
demanding performance requirements will be able to use AXIOM to create highly
scalable Web Services.</p>

<p>A third shift in Axis 2 is the de-emphasis of RPC-oriented Web Services
and a shift towards more document-oriented message style asynchronous service
interactions. With Axis2 clients can interact with servers in a number of
ways, and the client API provides both a blocking and non-blocking API. At
the time of Axis1's design, RPC-style, synchronous, request-response
interactions were the order of the day for Web services. Today service
interactions are much more message-oriented and exploit many different
message exchange patterns. The Axis2 engine architecture is careful not to
build in any assumptions of request-response patterns to ensure that it can
be used easily to support arbitrary message exchange patterns. Don't worry,
you'll still be able to use Axis2 like you used Axis1. One just have a richer
set of options for client-server interaction.</p>
