<title>Apache Axis2 - Next Generation Web Services</title>
<h2>Welcome to Apache Axis2</h2>

<p>
Apache Axis2 is an implementation of the 
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/soap/">Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) 
Recommendation</a> from the <a href="http://www.w3.org">W3C</a>.  Axis2 can be used
to provide and consume Web Services.
</p>

<p>From the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/soap/">W3C recommendation</a>:
<div style="padding-left: 20px; padding-top: 5px; font-style:italic;">"SOAP is a lightweight protocol for exchange of information in a decentralized, 
distributed environment. It is an XML based protocol that consists of three parts: 
an envelope that defines a framework for describing what is in a message and how to 
process it, a set of encoding rules for expressing instances of application-defined 
datatypes, and a convention for representing remote procedure calls and responses."
</div>
</p>

<p>
Apache Axis2 is an effort to re-implement both Axis/Java and 
Axis/C++ on a new architecture.  Building upon the &quot;handler chain&quot; model 
developed in Axis1, Axis2 introduces a more 
flexible pipeline architecture which lends itself to greater modularity
and extensibility.  This extensibility will allow Axis2 to act as a
foundation for a growing constellation of associated Web Services protocols including:
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=wsrm">WS-ReliableMessaging</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=wss">WS-Security</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.w3.org/Submission/ws-addressing/">WS-Addressing</a>
</ul>

<h2>Latest Release</h2>

<p><b>02 July 2005 - Apache Axis2 Version 0.9 Released!</b> <a href="releases.html#0.9">(Download 0.9)</a><p>

<p>Axis2 is taking shape. <a href="releases.html#0.9">Download it!</a>  This 0.9 release is a glimpse of 1.0 
that should be comming soon. This 0.9 release contains the following additional
features:
<ul>
  <li>XML Beans based data binding support</li>
  <li>Support for WS-Addressing, both the submission and final versions</li>
  <li>REST Web Service Support</li>
  <li>MTOM/SWA attachments support</li>
  <li>SAAJ implementation</li>
</ul>
We are getting closer to a 1.0 release, the remaining tasks to be completed 
before a 1.0 release include: SOAP 1.1 and 1.2 validation, JAX-RPC 1.1/2.0 compliance,
Complete XML infoset support for AXIOM, implementation of JMS transport, and Web
Service Policy support.</p>

<h2>Axis2 Background and Motivation</h2>

<p>
Axis1 was built under the assumption that other protocols such as WS-ReliableMessaging
would be integrated into Axis1's handler chain.  Axis1 had the concept of a 
MessageContext and a chain of transport, service, and global message handlers, but 
Axis1 lacked a clear extension architecture to enable clean composition of 
such layers. One of the key motivations for Axis2 is to provide a clean and 
simple environment for implementations of associated WS standards such as
<a href="http://ws.apache.org/sandesha/">Apache Sandesha</a> and 
<a href="http://ws.apache.org/wss4j/">Apache WSS4J</a>.  Implementations of
associated standards should be able to easily interface with the base 
SOAP Message handling system.   In summary, Axis2 has a more modular and
flexible message handling pipeline, it focuses on the details of message handling 
and provides clear hooks for implementations of associated Web Services 
standards and protocols.  This evolution will allow Axis to be a foundational 
technology for next generation Web Services.
</p>
 
<p>
Axis2 introduces a representation for SOAP messages called 
<b>AXIOM (AXIs Object Model)</b>. AXIOM consists of two parts: a complete XML Infoset 
representation and a SOAP Infoset representation. The XML Infoset 
representation provides a JDOM-esque API built atop a deferred model 
via a StAX-based (Streaming API for XML) pull parsing API. A key feature of AXIOM 
is that it allows one to stop building the XML tree and just access the pull stream 
directly; thus enabling both maximum flexibility and maximum performance. This 
approach allows Axis2 to support multiple levels of abstraction for consuming and 
offering Web services: using plain AXIOM, using generated code and statically 
data-bound data types and so on.  Developers with demanding performance 
requirements will be able to use AXIOM to create highly scaleable Web Services.
</p>

<p>
A third shift in Axis 2 is the de-emphasis of RPC-oriented Web 
Services and a shift towards more document-oriented, message style asynchronous 
service interactions.  With Axis2, clients can interact with servers in a number of 
ways, and the client API provides both a blocking and non-blocking API.  At the time of Axis1's design, RPC-style, 
synchronous, request-response interactions were the order of the day for Web 
services. Today service interactions are much more message-oriented and exploit 
many different message exchange patterns. The Axis2 engine architecture is careful 
to not build in any assumptions of request-response patterns to ensure that it can 
be used easily to support arbitrary message exchange patterns.
Don't worry,you'll still be able to use Axis2 like you used Axis1, you'll just have a richer set
of options for client-server interaction.
