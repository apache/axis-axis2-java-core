<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Using this IntelliJ IDEA plug-in you can either create a service archive
that can be deployed as a Web services to the Axis2 or generate a java class
file from a WSDL file. Installation process is described first here followed
by the above mentioned operations.</p>
<a name="installation"></a>

<h2>Installation</h2>

<p>First <a href="http://ws.apache.org/axis2/tools/index.html">download</a>
the plug-in which is a zipped file, and extract it into plugins directory in
IDEA installation directory or plugins directory in user directory
(user/idea/conf/plugins). If you have correctly extracted the file you would
see a directory called Axis2 in which there should be only one directory
called lib containing a few .jar files.</p>

<p>Next step is to restart IDEA so that the changes can take place. If the
plug-in has been installed correctly, when you restart IDEA you will see
following icons in IDEA .</p>

<p><img alt="Figure 1" src="images/idea-icons.jpg"></p>

<p>Also if you right-click on editor page of IDEA you would see a link to the
same plug-in.</p>

<p><img alt="Figure2" src="images/idea-popup.jpg"></p>

<p>When you click on either one of them a window (Page 1) will appear asking
you to select one of the following two options.</p>
<ol>
  <li><a href="#Create_Service_Archive">Create a service archive</a></li>
  <li><a href="#WSDL2Java_Code_Generation">WSDL2Java code generation</a></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Page 1:</strong></p>

<p><img alt="Figure3" src="images/fig1.jpg"></p>

<p>If you want to create a service archive obviously you must select 'Create
a service archive' option. Like wise, if u want to generate java class file
from a WSDL file you must select 'WSDL2Java codegeneration'.</p>

<h2><a name="WSDL2Java_Code_Generation">WSDL2Java Code Generation</a></h2>

<p>Select 'WSDL2Java codegeneration' and click OK to generate code from a
WSDL file. Then the following window will appear.</p>

<p><strong>WSDL2Java Page 2:</strong></p>

<p><img alt="Figure4" src="images/fig2.jpg"></p>

<p>To move on to the next page the WSDL file location must be given. The
Browse button can be used to easily browse for a file rather than having to
type the whole path.</p>

<p>Once the WSDL file is selected, click on Next button which will take you
to the page below.</p>

<p><strong>WSDL2Java Page 3:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Codegen options</strong> are to be selected here. By far this is
the most important page in this wizard, which determines the characteristics
of the code being generated.</p>

<p>Novices need not worry about these options since the most common options
are defaulted. Advanced users will find it very easy to "turn the knobs"
using these options.</p>

<p><img alt="Figure5" src="images/fig18.jpg"></p>

<p><strong>Here's some information on the options for selection:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Output language can be Java, C#. But we have not fully tested C#
    codegeneration, therefore, it is better to select Java as output
  language.</li>
  <li>Since Axis2 supports both synchronous and asynchronous client
    programming model, the tool has provided a way to select one of the two
    from this page.</li>
  <li>The default data binding type is adb (Axis2 data binding). Although the
    tool is capable of providing XML beans, due to class loading issues in
    XML beans, current implementation only generate code with OM and adb.</li>
  <li>As for the package name of the generated code, you can set the name as
    you wish.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>WSDL2Java Page 4:</strong></p>

<p><img alt="Figure6" src="images/fig3.jpg"></p>

<p>You can simply browse and select the output location/path (the location at
which the code is to be generated) using the Browse button. Because of the
Browse button you do not need to type in the output file path.</p>

<p><img alt="Fig4" src="images/fig4.jpg"></p>

<p>Once an output location is selected you can click on Finish button which
will generate the java class file. If code generation is successful then a
message box will appear acknowledging this fact a shown above.</p>

<p><a name="Create_Service_Archive" id="Create_Service_Archive"></a></p>

<h2>Create a Service Archive</h2>

<p>Select 'create a service archive' radio button on Page 1 of Axis2 IDEA
plug-in wizard.</p>

<p><strong>Page 1:</strong></p>

<p><img alt="Fig5" src="images/fig5.jpg"></p>

<p><strong>Service Archive Page 2:</strong></p>

<p>Page below will appear asking to select archive type</p>

<p><img alt="fig6" src="images/fig6.jpg"></p>

<p>In Axis2 user can deploy single service or service group. Therefore, you
can select either single service archive or service group archive for archive
type you want to create.</p>

<p>If you already have services.xml you can skip some of the steps in the
wizard by selecting 'I already have services.xml' and clicking on Next
button. If you do not have services.xml, select radio button 'Generate
services.xml' and click on Next button, in which case the tool will create
services.xml for you.</p>

<p>Depending on the options you selected on this page there can be three sub
wizards:</p>
<ol>
  <li><a href="sub12">Sub wizard 1</a> (Generate single service and its
    services.xml)</li>
  <li><a href="sub12">Sub wizard 2</a> (Generate service group and its
    services.xml)</li>
  <li><a href="sub3">Sub wizard 3</a> (Generate service/service group using
    already existing services.xml)</li>
</ol>

<p>1 &amp; 2 follow the same set of steps except for some looping mechanism
in the middle of the wizard.</p>
<a name="sub12"></a>

<h3>Sub Wizard 1 and Sub Wizard 2</h3>

<p><strong>Service Archive (sub wizards 1 &amp; 2) Page 3:</strong></p>

<p>From this page you have to select the location of the service classes
directory, from where you compile output location. You do not need to type
path, simply browse and select.</p>

<p><img alt="fig7" src="images/fig7.jpg"></p>

<p>When you click on Next button, wizard will move to the page below</p>

<p><strong>Service Archive (sub wizards 1 &amp; 2) Page 4:</strong></p>

<p>Here you select service specific external libraries and service WSDL
files. In the case of a service group you can add any number of WSDL files
depending on the services in the service group. If you want to add multiple
WSDL files to a single service type you can do that as well.</p>

<p><img alt="fig8" src="images/fig8.jpg"></p>

<p>To Add libraries first click on small (...) button to browse for library
file and then click on Add button. Once added the selected file will appear
in the list box.</p>

<p>To add WSDLs first click on small (...) button to browse for WSDL file and
then click Add button to add the file to the list.</p>

<p>See page below:</p>

<p><img alt="fig9" src="images/fig9.jpg"></p>

<p>After adding external libraries and service WSDL files click on Done
button and then Next button to move to next page.</p>

<p><strong>Service Archive (sub wizards 1 &amp; 2) Page 5:</strong></p>

<p>This page allows you to select service implementation class. In the case
of service group, same page will be looped to select multiple service
implementation classes. This process is explained in detail below.</p>

<p>Select a service implementation class by browsing and click on Load button
to load all the public methods in that class, after which you can select the
methods that you want to publish using the check boxes.</p>

<p><img alt="fig10" src="images/fig10.jpg"></p>

<p>In Service Name text box you can type the name of the service you want,
but remember that service name should be unique through out<em></em> the
system.</p>

<p>When you have completed this particular service click Done. In the case of
a service group when you click Done button for that particular service the
following dialog will appear with option to add more service(s) to a service
group.</p>

<p><img alt="fig11" src="images/fig11.jpg"></p>

<p>If you click Yes , you have to follow the same procedure to add some other
service(s) to service group.</p>

<p>If you click No, Next button will enable and you can go to next page.</p>

<p><a name="Note"><strong><em>Note: From this point onwards the steps are
similar to all the sub wizards.</em></strong></a></p>

<p><strong>Service Archive (sub wizards 1 &amp; 2) Page 6:</strong></p>

<p>This page displays the services.xml file, either the one given by you (in
the case of &#x201c;I already have services.xml&#x201d;) or the one generated
by the system (in the case of "generate services.xml")</p>

<p><img alt="fig12" src="images/fig12.jpg"></p>

<p>This page is editable and provide a way to add parameters and module
references to any level.</p>

<p>Note : When you click on either +Parameter or +ModuleRef buttons remember
that corresponding text will be added to the current mouse position.
Therefore click on the location you want to add the parameter<em> </em>or<em>
</em>module references and then click relevant button (+Parameter or
+ModuleRef).</p>

<p><strong>+Parameter button:</strong></p>

<p>If you click on the +Parameter button a window will appear asking to give
parameter name and parameter value.</p>

<p><img alt="fig13" src="images/fig13.jpg"></p>

<p>Note that you can also manually add parameters (without clicking on
+Parameter button ) to any where in the document as you wish.</p>

<p><strong>+ModuleRef button:</strong></p>

<p>Like wise, adding module references can be done by clicking on +ModuleRef
button in the page. You have to type the name of the module to be engaged as
shown in the following figure.</p>

<p><img alt="fig14" src="images/fig14.jpg"></p>

<p>When you complete this page press the Next button to go to final page.</p>

<p><strong>Service Archive (sub wizards 1 &amp; 2) Page 7:</strong></p>

<p><img alt="fig15" src="images/fig15.jpg"></p>

<p>Next step is to select output file location, the location in which archive
file should be created.</p>

<p>In the Archive Name textbox, type the name of the archive file you want to
place. This name will finally become the service group name.</p>

<p>Note : Do not include file extension when you type archive name. System
will generate that for you.</p>

<p>When you are done, click the Finish button. If everything has been done
successfully you will see following message.</p>

<p><img alt="fig16" src="images/fig16.jpg"></p>

<p>Note: Pages 6 &amp; 7 of sub wizards 1 &amp; 2 are common to sub wizard 3
from its page 3 onwards.</p>
<a name="sub3"></a>

<h3>Sub Wizard 3</h3>

<p>In the case where services.xml is already available, the steps are as
follows.</p>

<p><strong>Service Archive (sub wizard 3) Page 3:</strong></p>

<p><img alt="fig17" src="images/fig17.jpg"></p>

<p>This page allows you to select both location of services.xml and the
location of service classes directory. Click Select buttons and browse the
file system to find required document and location.</p>

<p>Click on Next button which will take you to a page which allows you to
edit services.xml in the same manner as 'Sub Wizard 1 &amp; Sub Wizard 2'
section's <a href="#Note">Page 6 - edit service descriptors</a>. Note that
Sub Wizard 3 from this point takes the same pages as 6 to 7 of Sub Wizards 1
&amp; 2.</p>
