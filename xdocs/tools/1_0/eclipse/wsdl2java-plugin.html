<h1>Code Generator Wizard - eclipse Plug-in</h1>

<p>This document explains the usage of this code generator plug-in for
eclipse. In other words, this document will guide you through the operations
of generating a WSDL file from a java class and/or generating a java class
file from a WSDL file.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The Axis2 code generator comes built-in with an <a
href="http://www.eclipse.org">eclipse</a> plug-in. This plug-in can be used
to generate a WSDL file from a java class (Java2WSDL) and/or a java class
file from a WSDL (WSDL2Java). First you need to install the plug-in. The
instruction for installation are given below.</p>
<a name="installation"></a>

<h2>Installation</h2>

<p>The easiest way to obtain the plug-in would be the binary distribution.
The packages plug-in would be available from the tools section of the
downloads page</p>

<p>If one needs to build the plugin from source it is not as trivial as
running the Maven build. The reason is that the plug-in depends heavily on
the Eclipse classes, which are only available in an Eclipse environment. The
recommended procedure is to run the create-project.xml (in the "modules\tool"
directory of the source distribution) build file which will create two
folders (the other one for the Service Archiver tool) and copy the necessary
files to relevant folders. Then Eclipse should be configured to open the
contents in a PDE project. Please go through the Eclipse documentation to
learn how to open projects in the PDE format.</p>

<p>Once you've obtained the plug-in just unzip the content of the plug-in
archive to the eclipse plug-in directory (if it is the zipped-binary version)
or copy the necessary folders to the eclipse plug-in directory and restart
Eclipse.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong> - This plug-in works on Eclipse version 3.1 and
upwards. The provided screen shots may slightly differ with what the user
would actually see but the functionality has not been changed.</p>

<h2>Operation - WSDL2Java</h2>

<p>If the plug-in is properly installed you should see a new wizard under the
"New" section.(use the File -&gt; New -&gt; Other or Ctrl + N )</p>

<p><img border="0" src="images/wsdl2java-screen0.jpg"></p>

<p>Selecting the wizard and pressing the Next button will start the code
generator wizard. Following is the first wizard page.</p>

<p><strong>Page 1:</strong></p>

<p><img src="images/wsdl2java-screen1.jpg"></p>

<p>Selecting the 'Generate Java source code from WSDL file' option and
clicking Next leads to the following page.</p>

<p><strong>WSDL2Java Page 2 :</strong></p>

<p><img border="0" src="images/wsdl2java-screen2.jpg"></p>

<p>To move on to the next page the WSDL file location must be given. The
Browse button can be used to easily browse for a file rather than typing the
whole path.</p>

<p><strong>WSDL2Java Page 3 :</strong></p>

<p>Once the WSDL file is selected, the next page will take you to the page
from where <strong>codegen options</strong> are to be selected. By far this
is the most important page in this wizard. This page determines the
characteristics of the code being generated.</p>

<p>Novices need not worry about these options since the most common options
are defaulted, but advanced users will find it very easy to "turn the knobs"
using these options.</p>

<p><img border="0" src="images/wsdl2java-screen3.jpg"></p>

<p>Once the options are selected, only the final step of the code generation
is left which is the selection of the output file location.</p>

<p><strong>WSDL2Java Page 4 :</strong></p>

<p>Here you can select the output file path by typing or browsing using the
Browse button. You have the option of browsing only workspace projects by
selecting the 'Browse Workspace projects only' 'checkbox.</p>

<p><img border="0" src="images/wsdl2java-screen4.jpg"></p>

<p>When the output file location is selected, the Finish button will be
enabled. Clicking the Finish button will generate the code and a message box
will pop up acknowledging the success. Well Done! You've successfully
completed Axis2 code generation.</p>
<a name="operation2"></a>

<h2>Operation - Java2WSDL</h2>

<p><strong>Page 1:</strong></p>

<p>For this operation you need to select the option which says 'Generate a
WSDL from a Java source file'</p>

<p><img border="0" src="images/java2wsdl-screen0.jpg"></p>

<p>Then click the Next button which will lead to the next page below.</p>

<p><strong>Java2WSDL Page 2:</strong></p>

<p><img border="0" src="images/java2wsdl-screen1.jpg"></p>

<p>In this page one needs to select the class to be exposed and the relevant
jar files /classes to be loaded as the classpath. After the libraries have
been set, the 'Test Class Loading' button must be clicked in order to test
whether the class is loadable. Unless the class loading is successful
proceeding to the Next button will not be enabled.</p>

<p>Once the classloading is successful and Next button is clicked the page
below will appear.</p>

<p><strong>Java2WSDL Page 3:</strong></p>

<p>This page allows the parameters to be modified by setting the options for
the generator.</p>

<p><img border="0" src="images/java2wsdl-screen2.jpg"></p>

<p><strong>Java2WSDL Page 4:</strong></p>

<p>Output file location can be browsed using the Browse button. Note that by
selecting 'browse Workspace projects only' check box you can browse for
workspace projects only. Once output file location and output WSDL file name
is add you can click the Finish button to complete generation.</p>

<p><img border="0" src="images/java2wsdl-screen3.jpg"></p>

<p>If a message box pops up acknowledging the success, then you've
successfully completed the Java2WSDL code generation. </p>
